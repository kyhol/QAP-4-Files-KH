// Create a reasonably complicated Object in JavaScript that contains attributes and methods for the Motelcustomer.  The  customer  attributes  should  include  (and  not be limited  to),  the customerâ€™sname, birth date,  gender,  androompreferences  (as  an  array),  payment method, mailing  address  (as  a  sub-object), phone  number, check-in,and  check-out  date  (as  a  sub-object),  and object methods  to  determine theirage  and  duration  of  stay.  The  JavaScript  code  should  also  create  a  template  literal  string,  or  properly formatted html, that describes the customer. In other words, writes a paragraph describing the customer with many of their personal attributes dynamically embedded in the string / html coming from the above object definition.

 const MotelCustomer = { //could set up as a let to change the values for new customers

        let age = today.getFullYear() - this.birthDate.getFullYear(); // Calculation to get age. uses today object and then minuses it by birthDate object
        return age; // returns age. There is an issue with this function, as it does not account for months but I feel it's fine for this QAP
    },
//To get the duration of stay I chose to use millisecondsperday, which brings back exact timing on the checkInDate and checkOutDate. "this." references the following object.
//.getTime gets the the elapsed time from January 1, 1970, 00:00:00 UTC. So it gets the time from said date until whats in the checkInDate value. Then you minus eachother in the duration section to give you the time elapsed between those two dates. Math.ceil is a function that returns the smallest integer greater than or equal to a given number. It rounds a number up to the nearest whole number. It rounds the duration in milisecondsperday / milisecondsperday to a whole number. 
    getDurationOfStay: function() {
        const millisecondsPerDay = 1000 * 60 * 60 * 24;

        return Math.ceil(durationInMilliseconds / millisecondsPerDay);
  }

// The following list gets printed to the console. .join joins the roomPreference list together. Everything else is straight forward - calling functions. toDateString makes the date readable.  It returns a string in the format ddd MMM dd yyyy ddd = day of week | mmm = abbreviated month | dd day from 1-31 | yyyy - Take a guess.

//This is an easy one I'm displaying to console a created sentence from roomPrefernce list. The dollar sign $ followed by curly braces {} in a template literal indicates that an expression should be evaluated and its result should be inserted into the string at that position. I call each piece of the list starting at 0. I could've called the last piece of the list with -1, but I chose to use 10, as 10 represents the 11th piece of the list, which is the final piece in said list.
