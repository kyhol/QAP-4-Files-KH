// Create a reasonably complicated Object in JavaScript that contains attributes and methods for the Motelcustomer.  The  customer  attributes  should  include  (and  not be limited  to),  the customerâ€™sname, birth date,  gender,  androompreferences  (as  an  array),  payment method, mailing  address  (as  a  sub-object), phone  number, check-in,and  check-out  date  (as  a  sub-object),  and object methods  to  determine theirage  and  duration  of  stay.  The  JavaScript  code  should  also  create  a  template  literal  string,  or  properly formatted html, that describes the customer. In other words, writes a paragraph describing the customer with many of their personal attributes dynamically embedded in the string / html coming from the above object definition.

 const MotelCustomer = { //could set up as a let to change the values for new customers
